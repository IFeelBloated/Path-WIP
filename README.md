QT:
The stencil code is written in QT and will therefore require QT Creator to be installed. QT Creator 4.5.0 Community edition has been tested and works.

How to build:
The included project files should be all you need to build, so just open the project in QT Creator and build the project.

How to run:
The compiled application takes two command line arguments.
The first argument is the path to the scene file that is being loaded to be rendered.
The second argument is the path of the file that the rendered image will be written out to.
